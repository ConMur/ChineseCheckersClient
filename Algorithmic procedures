/* ALGORITHMIC PROCEDURES */
We will check every of our piece to determine which move we will perform.
All pieces are referenced as point arrays.
We used two parallel matrices, one to track which spots 
we already visited, and the other which determiens the weight of each move.

For the first two moves, we always implement the same initial moves heuristic.

For all further moves, we use the weight matrix to track the best piece to move,
and where this piece will move. We will never move to a point we already visited,
as it will create an infinite loop.

The weight is determined by the position of the piece (farther pieces have priority)
and we will use the move method to determine where we will jump.
